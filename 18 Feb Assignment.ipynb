    "**when you use a ride-sharing app like Uber or Lyft. These apps use APIs provided by Google Maps or other mapping services to display real-time location data, route information, and estimated time of arrival to both the driver and the passenger. The app sends a request to the mapping service API, and the API returns the necessary data to the app.**"

    "1. APIs can streamline processes and reduce the amount of time and increased efficiency.\n",
    "2. APIs can provide a seamless and integrated experience for users. \n",
    "3. APIs can add new functionality to an application without requiring significant changes to the underlying code.\n",

    "**Disadvantage of API:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. APIs can be complex to understand and use, particularly for developers who are new to working with them.\n",
    "2. APIs can create security risks if not implemented properly.\n",
    "3. When using an API, applications become dependent on the availability and performance of the API provider."

APIs can use other protocols like FTP, SMTP, or SNMP, while Web APIs are always accessed over the internet using HTTP.**"

SOAP defines a set of rules for constructing messages, which can be sent over different protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, or JMS. SOAP services use XML schemas to define the structure and type of data, and WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to describe the service and its methods. SOAP services offer features like security, reliability, and transaction management, making them suitable for enterprise-level applications.**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. SOAP is a highly structured protocol. It complexity can make it difficult to understand and use.\n",
    "2. SOAP messages are typically larger than REST messages due to their XML-based format. So it happens slower performance and increased network latency.\n",

    "2. REST is resource-oriented, meaning that it operates on resources and performs actions on them using the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). In contrast, SOAP is action-oriented, where it sends a request for a specific action to be performed.\n",
    "3. REST is simpler and more lightweight than SOAP, while SOAP is more complex and requires more configuration.\n",
    "4. REST allows for multiple formats such as JSON, XML, and HTML for data exchange, making it more flexible than SOAP, which primarily uses XML.\n",
